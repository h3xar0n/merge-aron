# Merge Aron

This site is an adaptation of my portfolio with the express intention of showing the GitHub team that I would be an awesome addition.

It can be visited at the following link:

## Features
* Examples of features that GitHub and its platforms should have
* A reflection of my love for creating prototypes of new features!
* Extensive use of Bootstrap and Vue, both of which I had access to thanks to GitHub
* An idea of how to go about actually making the features
* Very smooth icons courtesy of Devicons and Font Awesome--also, thanks to GitHub
* A README file that demonstrates a basic desire and ability to communicate my ideas to an audience

## To-Do List
* Optimize images with Kraken, and use CSS sprites!
* Cross my fingers and envision the smiles of GitHub people appreciating the ideas
* Think of more awesome features that GitHub should have

### Why do I want to work at GitHub?

I love using GitHub and feel connected to its goal of making collaboration and growth as accessible as possible. GitHub has helped me expand my skills as a developer, get contract work, and mentor newer developers, and I know it can do much more for many other people.

I have also experienced the difficulty of working with a team to deploy a production-quality app *without* GitHub. The main reason was that half of our international team was unfamiliar with how to use it and felt they didn't have the time to learn. While excellent tools such as GitHub Desktop and Atom's built-in Git features should have made this easier, we simply didn't learn that they existed until we had already launched. I want to make the experience of landing on GitHub's page to pushing a commit as fast as possible so that other teams in our position figure out how to use the excellent tools GitHub has to offer.

Beyond this personal goal, I love GitHub's look and feel, how it presents its tools, and the major platforms that it offers. As I became more comfortable using the Desktop app, I transitioned to using the terminal--but then, when I replaced Vim with Atom, I discovered that Atom's built-in Git feature was a much faster and more informative way to work. The fact that Atom highlights every line I've changed within the editor and also allows me to click the files that I want to stage for commits makes it far more useful than any other text editor.

These thoughtful design features speak to me; they show me a team of thinkers whose will to create is based on authentic demand rather than marketing gimmicks or redundant features. I think my background as both a product owner and a developer would make my work at GitHub personally rewarding. I would essentially be making things that I have deeply wanted to use.

### Why do I feel I would be a good fit for this role?

My background in product management, web development, and education makes me uniquely suited for this role.

At Mosaica Education and Gameplan, I created features for a wide variety of distinct users, often within the same environment.

I redesigned our learning management system (LMS) at Mosaica to be different for students and teachers based on their respective needs. This work was largely guided by feedback from teachers, so building rapport with them and discovering the best solutions to their problems gave me excellent experience in team-based problem solving. After redesigning the general system and earning the confidence of the teachers, I used their continuous feedback throughout the year to improve over 200 curriculum units.

At Gameplan, I created the product overview video (in a single day!) and worked with our CTO to translate features into technical requirements. Much later on, as a developer, I took general wireframes from a UI designer and found ways to make them more interactive both for job seekers and employers. Thanks to my familiarity with JavaScript libraries, I was aware of possible interactions that the UI designer hadn't included yet, and we made excellent progress exchanging ideas and rapidly creating prototypes. When I wasn't writing code, I was providing thoughtful and empathetic feedback to other developers and designers.

As a developer, I have built production-quality apps and sites with Ruby on Rails, Javascript (and frameworks and libraries such as Vue, React, Angular, and jQuery), HTML5, and CSS3. I love writing files in code as much as READMEs in English, and of course, I love pushing both to the repository on GitHub to get those daily boxes as dark as possible.

### What do I suppose are the challenges of working remotely, and how would I address them?

While living in Moscow and serving as the product owner on a scrum team with developers based in India, Ukraine, and the US, I only expected to have issues with timezone and language differences. While those issues did occasionally arise, they were relatively easy to resolve by creating a set of standards.

The biggest issues turned out to pertain to our ability to trust other members of the remote team and, by extension, our ability to communicate when an obstacle arose. Given very limited information about what other teammates are doing at a given moment, it could be tempting to jump to negative conclusions, such as, "I feel like the only one who is doing anything." While these thoughts simply aren't true, there is no immediate evidence to dispel them, which can lead to a decline in morale or, just as bad, to teammates taking on an unbalanced workload to compensate for the perceived lack.

This issue can be prevented through team-building exercises, as well as the ability to easily see what other people are currently working on. I love GitHub's time card feature, and beyond just the manager, it can help other teammates better understand each others' contributions. This ability is especially important in non-hierarchical teams where people distribute tasks amongst themselves.

I have also found it very useful to have constant forms of "background" communication such as Slack, where people can post questions and comments on designated channels and get any remote teammate (rather than a specific one) to respond quickly. This horizontal, open form of communication is much better than using email or other heavily tunneled forms that cost us too much time with no guarantee of results.

Overall, the challenges of remote work can be overcome by simply focusing on the authentic benefits of working side-by-side and then finding ways to recreate them. In my experience, those benefits are (1) the ability to express one's needs without too much effort and (2) the ability to check on what others are doing in case I need help (or, at the very least, a morale boost).
